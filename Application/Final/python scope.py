""" There are four types of scopes in python
Local Scope: A variable that is inside a function is determined as local scope of that function, and we can not access that varible outside the function. 

Global Scope: A variable that is in the main body of the Python code is a global variable and belongs to the global scope. It is possible to access global variable at anywhere from the program.

Built-in Scope: Built-in scope is a special Python scope thatâ€™s created or loaded whenever you run a script or open an interactive session.
Enclosing Scope: Enclosing function can exists for nested function and it is special type of scope.

In our above function, The built in e is printed first, after that it print the innter e = 77.98 and lastly it print the global value of e = 33.23.
here, in inner funtion the value of e is changed, and if we remove or comment the e = 77.98 that is enclosed scope then the print function in inner funtion will print the local scope of outer function e = 43.23
so we can say ,priority level of scope : enclosed>local>global>builtin
