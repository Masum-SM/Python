""" There are four types of scopes in python
Local Scope: A variable that is inside a function is determined as local scope of that function, and we can not access that varible outside the function. 

Global Scope: A variable that is in the main body of the Python code is a global variable and belongs to the global scope. It is possible to access global variable at anywhere from the program.

Built-in Scope: Built-in scope is a special Python scope thatâ€™s created or loaded whenever you run a script or open an interactive session.
Enclosing Scope: Enclosing function can exists for nested function and it is special type of scope.
