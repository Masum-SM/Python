Suppose you have a program that converts a string into Upper, Capitalized and Lower style using three different functions. Now create a test script for testing the three functionality of that program. Run using PyTest.

a . Write a function make_upper() to make the string in uppercase

b . Write a function make_capital() to make the string capitalized

c . Write a function make_lower() to make the string lowercase

Write a function named test_script() and write your code inside this function.
